Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice


Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice
    
Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This  
> paragraph has two lines. <!-- The newline requires a double space -->
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.

Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested


Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
